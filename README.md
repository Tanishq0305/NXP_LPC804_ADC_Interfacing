# NXP_LPC804_ADC_Interfacing
1. This is second part of my project where I interfaced ADC of LPC804 EVK and displayed the input voltage across the potentiometer on the 4-digit 7-segment display.
2. I used adc_interrupt demo code for the reference and made changes in that code so that it'll display the output on the Serial monitor as well as on the display board.
3. The source code is present in the folder named "source". 
4. You can see few of the draft codes along with the main code in the test.c file there which I used while developing the logic.
5. Pin configuration is defined at the beginning of the code.
Happy Coding :)
